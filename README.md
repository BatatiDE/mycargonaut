- **Gradle**: For backend builds

---

### 2️⃣ Installation and Setup

#### **Backend Setup**
1. Navigate to the `backend` folder:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```
2. Update `application.properties` with your PostgreSQL credentials:
   ```properties
   spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://<DB_HOST>:<DB_PORT>/<DB_NAME>
   spring.datasource.username=<DB_USER>
   spring.datasource.password=<DB_PASSWORD>
   ```
3. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew bootRun
   ```
4. The backend will run at **http://localhost:8080**.

#### **Frontend Setup**
1. Navigate to the `frontend` folder:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Configure environment variables in `.env.local`:
   ```plaintext
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://<DB_USER>:<DB_PASSWORD>@<DB_HOST>:<DB_PORT>/<DB_NAME>
   NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-secret-key
   ```
4. Start the frontend server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
5. The frontend will run at **http://localhost:3000**.

   ```
2. Create a pull request from `features/*` to `develop`.
3. CI/CD will:
   - Run linting, tests, and build processes.
   - Deploy the application to the staging environment.

### Production
Production deployment occurs after merging `develop` into `main`:
1. Create a pull request from `develop` to `main`.
2. Once approved, the application will deploy to production.
